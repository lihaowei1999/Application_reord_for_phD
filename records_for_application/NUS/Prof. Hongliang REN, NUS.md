Dear Prof. Hongliang REN:
	I'm Lihaowei, a junior student from Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University. To be detailed, I mainly focus on subjects about medical imaging for surgery utility. As I'm now in grade 3 and is looking for a laboratory for further study as a phD student, I found your lab on the website of NUS BME. The projects you are working on arouse my interest to a great extent. I wonder if there is any possibility I can participate in some projects in the coming summer holiday, or even in this semester, which is better, in an online way. And I hope that I can learn more about the jobs the laboratory is now focusing on. Following are some more detailed information about me for the passed 5 semesters.
	
	The GPA of the passed semesters, respectively, are 3.5, 4.0, 3.896, 3.867, 3.844 with a full mark of 4.0, and I ranked 1st in the second semester and the whole second school year. I won the National scholarship in the second school year. In terms of scientific research, I worked on liquid metal in the second year, and was listed as a co-author in an article recently submitted to Advanced Functional Material, which haven't received a reply yet. However, in the third year, I found myself more interested in some imaging problems, so I joined the lab of Prof. GuangZhi Wang. And I'm now working on imaging visualization with Hololens. This project is still running, and I'm now focusing on the programming part of this project after preparation of basic knowledge and software environment for some time. On the other hand, I have been a leader of a group job which was devoted to classification of skeleton stream. I was mainly responsible for skeleton fetching in both way of multi view reconstruction (with alphapose as a basic 2d skeleton detector), and rgbd data basing on Kinect 2.0. We are now doing some extensive jobs on this project, and I'm know working on GCN as a better classification network, comparing to the methods we once used(LSTM and KNN). As parts of other class projects, I have also done some jobs in Unet for registration and modeling for Covid-2019.

	After I have done multiple jobs, I found myself interested in medical imaging, especially those can combine hardware(like cameras, surgery robots, sensors, etc.) and software(like some deep learning methods). I really hope that I can do some useful jobs in this area and can create some differences which can facilitate medical developing. 

	I really hope that I would be accepted to participate in some projects in your lab. And if possible, I would like to apply for a phD in NUS, BME. So I would be glad if you can tell me some information about the plan for new phDs in your lab next year, as I would graduate from Tsinghua University in June, 2022.

Yours

Lihaowei

Dear Haowei,

Thank you for your email & interest.

We have a few ongoing projects involving remote interns like you - Can have any of your CV, transcripts, sample/demo codes/writings or anything else that can help us evaluate your background?

As for PhD options, are you interested in EE CUHK?
http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/curriculum/mphil-phd-programme/admission 
You shall have a good chance for HKPFS, very well paid >3000USD/m
Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)
Established by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC) in 2009.
Aims to attract the best students from around the world to pursue PhD studies in Hong Kong.
Provides a monthly stipend of HK$26,600 (approx. US$3,410) and a conference travel allowance of HK$13,300 (approx. US$1,700) per year during the normative study period for up to three years.
Check out: http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/curriculum/mphil-phd-programme/admission

I suggest this as you may know from my webpage that I'll be mainly HK-based though I still have some Ph.D. students at NUS.


Regards,
Hongliang

Dear Prof. Hongliang REN:

	Thanks for your reply.

	Attached .pdf file is my CV. I'm very sorry that most of my codes/writings are part of some on-going projects, so I can only attach some from classes in code&writing.zip. For detailed information, itk/vtk folder contains two simple demo for segmentation and display, modeling_liver contains some MATLAB codes based on the article in the article. Submit_multprov contains some MATLAB code trying to fit 2019-nCoV data with basic SIR model where some changes have been applied to gamma and beta change depending on time, results are contained in the pic_Save folder. Writings are relatively difficult to be found, so I attached a research on AEP I have done last semester as a part of the class presentation(4 researches in total for that class, this is the first), however it is in Chinese. Doppler.. folder contain a simple matlab UI design, with report written with tex. Biochemistry_Smac_report.pdf is a very early written article report ppt basing on LaTeX Beamer.

	CUHK is a very good choice for me, which I would consider seriously, but I wonder if there is still any phD plan in NUS. On the other hand, may I have more information on the remote projects ?
