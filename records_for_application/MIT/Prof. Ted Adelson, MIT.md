Dear Prof. Ted Adelson:
	I'm Lihaowei, a junior student from Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University. I'm really interested in the vision and robots, and the project I'm now working mainly focusing on this two themes, in a medical way. As I'm now in grade 3 and is looking for a laboratory for further study as a phD student, I found your lab on the website csail.mit.edu. The projects you are working on arouse my interest to a great extent. I wonder if there is any possibility I can participate in some projects in the coming summer holiday. And I hope that I can learn more about the jobs the laboratory is now focusing on. Following are some more detailed information about me for the passed 5 semesters.
	
	The GPA of the passed semesters, respectively, are 3.5, 4.0, 3.896, 3.867, 3.844 with a full mark of 4.0, and I ranked 1st in the second semester and the whole second school year in our department . I won the National scholarship in the second school year. 

	In terms of scientific research, I worked on liquid metal for a year, and was listed as a co-author in an article recently submitted to Advanced Functional Material. However, in the following year, I found myself more interested in some imaging problems, which have a strong combination with hardware like surgery robots and head-mounted display, so I joined the lab of Prof. GuangZhi Wang, which is focusing on medical imaging, surgery navigation and robots. And I'm now working on imaging visualization with Hololens. This project is still running, and I'm now focusing on the coding part of this project after preparation of basic knowledge and software environment for some time. On the other hand, I have been a leader of a group job which was devoted to classification of skeleton stream. I was mainly responsible for skeleton fetching in both way of multi view reconstruction (with alphapose as a basic 2d skeleton detector), and rgbd data basing on Kinect 2.0. We are now doing some extensive jobs on this project, and I'm know working on GCN as a better classification network, comparing to the methods we once used(LSTM and KNN). As parts of other class projects, I have also done some jobs in Unet for registration and modeling for Covid-2019.

	After I have done multiple jobs, I found myself interested in imaging, especially those can combine hardware(like cameras, surgery robots, sensors, etc.) and software(like some deep learning methods, focusing on CV). I really hope that I can do some useful jobs in this area and can create some differences.  

	I really hope that I would be accepted to participate in some projects in your lab. And if possible, I would like to apply for a phD in MIT. So I would be glad if you can tell me some information about the plan for new phDs in your lab next year, as I would graduate from Tsinghua University in June, 2022.

Yours

Lihaowei
